// Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL)
// Read: It reads the user’s input (a JavaScript expression).
// Eval: It evaluates the input.
// Print: It prints the result of the evaluation.
// Loop: It goes back to waiting for the next input.

// The REPL in Node.js stands for Read–Eval–Print–Loop, and it's basically an interactive playground for JavaScript. Think of it as a live coding console where you can type in code, run it instantly, and see the results—perfect for quick experiments, debugging, or just learning the ropes.

// The REPL module provides a implementation that is avaliable both
// as a standalone program or includible in other applications.

// Basically it's a place where you can write/run JS code.
// Just open your terminal and type: node

// // Bonus Features
// shift + enter to write multiple line code like functions
// Underscore _ variable: Stores the result of the last expression.

// .break (sometimes you get stuck, this gets you out)
// .clear (Alias for .break)
// .editor (Enter editor mode (Ctrl+D) to finish, (Ctrl+C) to cancel)
// .exit (Exit the REPL)
// .help (Print this help message)
// .load (Loads JS from a file into the REPL session e.g .load .filepath)
// .save (Save all evaluated commands in this REPL session to a file e.g .save /filepath)
